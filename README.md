# UltrasoundML
## Predictions of soft tissue indentation stiffness using ML and ultrasound data. 

Base data comes from: https://multisbeta.stanford.edu/

Linear mixed models were developed in a forthcoming publication (TBA).

### 4 separate deep learning models were generated:

  Multilayer perceptrons:
  
  1. Demographics multilayer perceptron
    
  2. Demographics + tissue thicknesses (from manually annotated ultrasound images)
    
  Convolutional neural networks:
  
  3. Raw ultrasound images
    
  4. Ultrasound images + demographics + image meta data
